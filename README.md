# My UAntwerpen CS Journey
Here you will find all my summaries from my Informatics Bachelor's at UA. Although the program is in Dutch, everything here will be in English, since it’s easier for me and also more accessible for international students whose primary language is not Dutch (I’m one of them).

I created this repository on GitHub to share my summaries, projects, study methods, personal experiences with the courses, and anything else that might help new students or make this journey a little bit easier.

If you have any questions about anything, feel free to email me at: abdellah.elmoussaoui@student.uantwerpen.be

I’m currently in my sophomore year, so this repository is most useful for first-year students. But don’t worry—I’ll keep updating it throughout the year, promise! :)
