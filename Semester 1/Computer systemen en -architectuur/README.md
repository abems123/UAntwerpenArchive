# Computer Systemen en Architectuur
This was one of the most enjoyable courses in the first semester. It was challenging, but it answered many of my questions about how computers actually work. The course dives deep into computer architecture, and by the end you’ll understand how to turn 0’s and 1’s into real information and even design a microprocessor.
It's seperated into 2 sections, Computer Systems and Computer Architecture. 

## Computer Systemen
In this part, you’ll learn general but fundamental concepts of computer science that provide the foundation for everything that follows.

## Computer Architecture
Here, you’ll get hands-on experience with the “real” side of computers—the things you can see and build. Using Logisim, you’ll design circuits, starting from basic logic gates and gradually working up to creating a complete processor.

I scored 17/20 in total. I managed to get full points on the Computer Architecture assignments because they were really fun. I also did well in the Computer Systems part. The practical exam was quite easy, and the theory exam tends to be the same each year—you’ll probably receive to the questions and answers from classmates in your class group.

You’ll be provided with everything you need on Blackboard, including the assignments and the documents you should read in order to solve them.
If you have any questions, you can always contact the assistants or the professor—they usually reply as soon as they can.
