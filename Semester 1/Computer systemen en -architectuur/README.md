# Computer Systemen en Architectuur
This was one of the most enjoyable courses in the first semester. It was challenging, but it answered many of my questions about how computers actually work. The course dives deep into computer architecture, and by the end you’ll understand how to turn 0’s and 1’s into real information and even design a microprocessor.
It's seperated into 2 sections, Computer Systems and Computer Architecture. 

## Computer Systemen
In this part, you’ll learn general but fundamental concepts of computer science that provide the foundation for everything that follows.

## Computer Architecture
Here, you’ll get hands-on experience with the “real” side of computers—the things you can see and build. Using Logisim, you’ll design circuits, starting from basic logic gates and gradually working up to creating a complete processor.

# My Method of Studying
First of all, you should follow what the assistants and professor suggest—that’s a good foundation, but for me, it wasn’t enough. In addition to the book Computer Organization and Design, I watched most of [the Digital Electronics playlist by Neko Academy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjMH3mWf6kwqiTbT798eAOm). This made it much easier for me to grasp the concepts. My approach was to first watch the video, then write down everything from it, because writing helps with understanding and remembering the information.

For topics like the ALU, MIPS, and other parts, I also watched videos by [Padraic Edgington on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@padraicedgington901/playlists). His explanations were very clear and made the concepts much easier for me to understand.

You’ll be provided with everything you need on Blackboard, including the assignments and the documents you should read in order to solve them.
If you have any questions, you can always contact the assistants or the professor—they usually reply as soon as they can.

# How I Did in This Course
I scored 17/20 in total. I managed to get full points on the Computer Architecture assignments because they were really fun. I also did well in the Computer Systems part. The practical exam was quite easy, and the theory exam tends to be the same each year—you’ll probably receive the questions and answers from classmates in your class group chat.

I spent a total of 177 hours on this course. I attended most of the hoorcolleges (lectures), but only a few of the werkcolleges (practical sessions)—mainly the first ones.
