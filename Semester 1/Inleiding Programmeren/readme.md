# Inleiding Programmeren
This was the easiest course for me since I wasn’t new to programming—I scored **20/20** just by attending the classes and solving the problems on Inginious.

I did revise some concepts using the [C++ tutorial for beginners playlist by Bro Code on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOMHoXIcxze_lP97j2Ase2on). I also watched a complete Python playlist (since Python was new to me). It’s in Arabic—[click here if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoP3S2S1qTfCUdNazAZY1LFALcUr0Vbs9)

# Disclaimer
It’s absolutely not recommended to just copy my Inginious solutions—you’ll most likely fail the course if you do that. I’m sharing them here so you can **compare your solutions with mine** and use them as a reference. That way, if you get stuck, you can check how I solved the same problem. But if you rely only on copying without understanding, you’ll get cooked! :)
