# Discrete Wiskunde
Discrete Math was one of the hardest courses I had in the first semester, because many of the concepts were completely new to meâ€”and it was also the first time I studied them in Dutch.

# My Method of Studying
I recommend attending all the classes (even though I didnâ€™t ðŸ™ƒ). Instead, I watched all the recorded lectures by prof Stijn Symens. They were really helpful, and I made sure to write down everything he wrote, since writing things out is the best way to remember them. This is especially important for the theory exam.

I also followed two excellent YouTube playlists:

[Discrete Math I â€“ Kimberly Brehm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz)  
[Discrete Math II / Combinatorics â€“ Kimberly Brehm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII0sGLCJeqDB3y63HZ6lM5LJ)

Both were extremely useful for understanding the material and passing the exams. Again, I recommend writing down all important information while watching.

I also solved almost all the exercises from the book and then watched the recorded solution videos, which helped a lot.

I also practiced theory questions from previous years, since many of them are repeated. The professor usually starts with simple and easy questions and then adds more difficult ones. During the theory exam, heâ€™s very supportiveâ€”if you get stuck halfway through an answer, he often gives helpful hints to guide you in the right direction.

# How I Did in This Course
In the end, I scored 13/20 for this course. I started the real preparation only one month before the exam, which wasnâ€™t enough time. I spent a total of 165 hours, and Iâ€™m confident that if I had started earlier (with the same amount of study time), I could have scored at least 15/20.
